# Hello to anyone that is reading this! Welcome to my README for this project!
# My main goal for this project is to assess the energy consumption from residential and regional sectors in the metro Detroit area. This involves utilizing APIs and python data cleaning, along with Tableau data visualization techniques.

# All of the files besides the pokemon_test_api are related to the Climatiq API. The link for the pokemon tutorial is this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVQNywo4AbU
# I had used it for reference to get a basic understanding of APIs and setup.


# I also referenced the Climatiq API tutorials, such as this one: https://www.climatiq.io/docs/guides/how-tos/using-python
# It had examples for Climatiq/Python integration which served as a good starting point
# The climatq_test.py was referencing the QuickStart tutorial: https://www.climatiq.io/docs/guides/tutorials/quickstart


# ChatGPT was used in the following instances:


# Refining problem statement:
# “How can I narrow my current problem statement: {insert original problem statement} to something with a narrower scope, not primarily focused on AI, while still utilizing Climatiq API’s emission factor estimates? Would this look best with a scope of a specific area, such as residential, or a specific US city?”


# I was trying to change my previous script that was based on climatq_test.py to hold a range of years, so I asked ChatGPT how to go from what I had (just one year) to 2020-2024 data assessment: “How can I take my current script and modify it so that a broader range of years can be observed (2020-2023)?“


# Once I considered having different energy scenarios, I asked ChatGPT: "How can I effectively loop through these three different energy scenarios and output separate statements for each?"


# When I thought at first that I had to use cURL in order to work with Climatiq API, I asked ChatGPT for more insight and also looked up several examples/video tutorials of cURL.


# Lastly, when looking at the data from the dataframe created from pandas, I asked ChatGPT: “Based on the data found, what are some insights or trends, patterns/relationships that you might see which would be worth exploring in a data visualization?”
